I work primarily with React on the frontend and have practical experience with backend technologies like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, SQL, and RESTful APIs. My focus is on writing clean code, understanding how systems work end-to-end, and continuously improving through hands-on project development rather than relying only on theory.",
